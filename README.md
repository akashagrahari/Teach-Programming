# Teach-Programming
Students look enthusiastic right now. Let's see how it pans out. Mostly but not limited to Java

#Getting Started
1. Install Ubuntu
2. Install Java,git and sublime-text on ubuntu
3. <i><b>Optional</b></i> Install Oh My Zsh on Ubuntu

5. Setup SSH key for github (password-less login)

#Read-Up (Brief)
1. About git - branch, branching, clone, fork, stash, commit, push, pull, etc.
2. What are environment variables? Where are they set in Ubuntu? bashrc/bash_profile? zsh/bash? Have you setup JAVA_HOME?
3. Compiler/Interpreter?
4. Data-Structures
5. OOP

Approach the problems when you can make programs like "Hello world". Print a series (1,3,5,7,9). Take input from user and do something with it. Print sum/product of a series based on user input.

#Problem 1
WAP in Java to input a number and test whether it's a palindrome or not.

#Problem 2

<i>BID$OSE$N*A$DD$**$</i></br>

<b>Hint</b> -
